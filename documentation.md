* Include a README file with the project name, purpose, live URL, key features, and any npm packages you have used.  
* Secure Frontend configuration keys using environment variables.  
* Secure your MongoDB credentials using the environment variable.  
* Create a design that encourages recruiters. Color contrast should please the eye & ensure that the website has proper alignment, space, and the website does not express gobindo design.   
* If we found your project similar to any project of your module / conceptual / assignment. You will get 0  and may miss the chance of any upcoming reward.  

### **Deployment Guideline**

* If your Deployment is not okay you will get 0 and may miss the chance of our upcoming rewards.   
* Ensure that your server is working perfectly on production and not throwing any CORS / 404 / 504 Errors.

* The application will have a registration page from where users can register an account for himself. When a new user will register an account by default the role of the user will be **“donor”. \[** Do not enforce the email verification method and forget & reset password method, as it will inconvenience the examiner. If you want, you can add it after receiving the assignment result. **\].** Registration form will have the following input fields

  * email  
  * name  
  * avatar(use imageBB to upload the user avatar)  
  * blood group(a selector with option A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-)  
  * district(select option)  
  * upazila(select option)  
  * password  
  * confirm\_password

  💡 **status:** Every user will have a default status **“active”**. Admin can block a user. Then the status for the user will be **“blocked”**. We will talk more about this feature in admin section

    💡 **You will find data for the district and upazila in the resources section & social login is not required. You do not need to implement any social login.**

### **3.2 Login**

* Application will have a login page from where registered users can log in using their email and password. Users can navigate to the registration page from the login page and vise versa

### **4\. Dashboard(private🔒)**

  * Every user(admin, donner, or volunteer) will have a profile page. From where the user is able to see his name, email, avatar, address(district, upazila), blood group and able to update profile information. \[ use a form to show all the information and keep an edit button on top of the form. Initially the form will not be editable. While the edit button will be clicked then the form will be editable and will appear a save button to save updated data to the database. After saving the updated data the form will go back to its initial state. It means again an edit button will appear on top of the form and form will be not editable.

**UI Design Requirements:** 

* **Unique Design:** First, decide what kind of website you want to make. Then, search online or check out websites like ThemeForest to get ideas for the design. But remember, your website idea shouldn't be similar to any projects you've done before or to any examples in our modules or conceptual sessions.  
* You can also look for free resources on [blogs](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/free-images-and-resources-collection-for-website-c77f2fc46ce5) to help with your website. 

1. Keep the main heading style (font, size, color) consistent across all sections.

2. Keep paragraph spacing balanced and text easily readable.  
3. Maintain uniform image sizes and spacing.

     4\.   Use the same button style as on the home page.

5. Ensure good spacing and proper alignment.  
6. Navbar, Keep the heading/logo same style and size as on the home page.  
7. Use a grid layout with equal image sizes.  
8. Keep all cards equal height and width (especially in services, projects, or products section)  
9. Use the new X logo instead of the old Twitter bird to match the latest rebrand  
10. Responsiveness: Make it responsive for all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
